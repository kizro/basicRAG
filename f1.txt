Abstract
Because “out-of-the-box” large language models are capable of generating a great
deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an
attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures—so-called “jailbreaks” against LLMs—these attacks have
required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. Attempts at automatic
adversarial prompt generation have also achieved limited success. In this paper, we
propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to
generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when
attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims
to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather
than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy
and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt
generation methods.
Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are
highly transferable, including to black-box, publicly released, production LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for
many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case,
Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix induces objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as
well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. Interestingly, the success rate of this attack transfer is much higher against the GPT-based
models, potentially owing to the fact that Vicuna itself is trained on outputs from
ChatGPT. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial
attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such
systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information. Code is available

Figure 1: Aligned LLMs are not adversarially aligned. Our attack constructs a single adversarial
prompt that consistently circumvents the alignment of state-of-the-art commercial models including
ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and Llama-2 without having direct access to them. The examples shown
here are all actual outputs of these systems. The adversarial prompt can elicit arbitrary harmful
behaviors from these models with high probability, demonstrating potentials for misuse. To achieve
this, our attack (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) finds such universal and transferable prompts by
optimizing against multiple smaller open-source LLMs for multiple harmful behaviors. These are
further discussed in Section 3 and the complete unabridged transcripts are provided in Appendix B.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on massive text corpora scraped from the
internet, which are known to contain a substantial amount of objectionable content. Owing to this,
recent LLM developers have taken to “aligning” such models via various finetuning mechanisms1 ;
there are different methods employed for this task [Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai et al., 2022b, Korbak
et al., 2023, Glaese et al., 2022], but the overall goal of these approaches is to attempt ensure that
these LLMs do not generate harmful or objectionable responses to user queries. And at least on
the surface, these attempts seem to succeed: public chatbots will not generate certain obviouslyinappropriate content when asked directly.
In a largely separate line of work, there has also been a great deal of effort invested into identi1

“Alignment” can generically refer to many efforts to make AI systems better aligned with human values. Here
we use it in the narrow sense adopted by the LLM community, that of ensuring that these models do not generate
harmful content, although we believe our results will likely apply to other alignment objectives.

fying (and ideally preventing) adversarial attacks on machine learning models [Szegedy et al., 2014,
Biggio et al., 2013, Papernot et al., 2016b, Carlini and Wagner, 2017b]. Most commonly raised
in computer vision domains (though with some applications to other modalities, including text),
it is well-established that adding small perturbations to the input of a machine learning model
can drastically change its output. To a certain extent, similar approaches are already known to
work against LLMs: there exist a number of published “jailbreaks”: carefully engineered prompts
that result in aligned LLMs generating clearly objectionable content [Wei et al., 2023]. Unlike
traditional adversarial examples, however, these jailbreaks are typically crafted through human
ingenuity—carefully setting up scenarios that intuitively lead the models astray—rather than automated methods, and thus they require substantial manual effort. Indeed, although there has
been some work on automatic prompt-tuning for adversarial attacks on LLMs [Shin et al., 2020,
Wen et al., 2023, Jones et al., 2023], this has traditionally proven to be a challenging task, with
some papers explicitly mentioning that they had been unable to generate reliable attacks through
automatic search methods [Carlini et al., 2023]. This owes largely to the fact that, unlike image
models, LLMs operate on discrete token inputs, which both substantially limits the effective input
dimensionality, and seems to induce a computationally difficult search.
In this paper, however, we propose a new class of adversarial attacks that can in fact induce
aligned language models to produce virtually any objectionable content. Specifically, given a (potentially harmful) user query, our attack appends an adversarial suffix to the query that attempts
to induce negative behavior. that is, the user’s original query is left intact, but we add additional
tokens to attack the model. To choose these adversarial suffix tokens, our attack consists of three
key elements; these elements have indeed existed in very similar forms in the literature, but we find
that it is their careful combination that leads to reliably successful attacks in practice.
1. Initial affirmative responses. As identified in past work [Wei et al., 2023, Carlini et al.,
2023], one way to induce objectionable behavior in language models is to force the model to
give (just a few tokens of) an affirmative response to a harmful query. As such, our attack
targets the model to begin its response with “Sure, here is (content of query)” in response to
a number of prompts eliciting undesirable behavior. Similar to past work, we find that just
targeting the start of the response in this manner switches the model into a kind of “mode”
where it then produces the objectionable content immediately after in its response.
2. Combined greedy and gradient-based discrete optimization. Optimizing over the adversarial suffix is challenging due to the fact that we need to optimize over discrete tokens to
maximize the log likelihood of the attack succeeding. To accomplish this, we leverage gradients at the token level to identify a set of promising single-token replacements, evaluate
the loss of some number of candidates in this set, and select the best of the evaluated substitutions. The method is, in fact, similar to the AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] approach,
but with the (we find, practically quite important) difference that we search over all possible
tokens to replace at each step, rather than just a single one.
3. Robust multi-prompt and multi-model attacks. Finally, in order to generate reliable attack
suffixes, we find that it is important to create an attack that works not just for a single
prompt on a single model, but for multiple prompts across multiple models. In other words,
we use our greedy gradient-based method to search for a single suffix string that was able
to induce negative behavior across multiple different user prompts, and across three different
models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13b Zheng et al. [2023] and Guanoco-7B Dettmers et al.
[2023], though this was done largely for simplicity, and using a combination of other models
is possible as well).
3

Putting these three elements together, we find that we can reliably create adversarial suffixes
that circumvent the alignment of a target language model. For example, running against a suite of
benchmark objectionable behaviors, we find that we are able to generate 99 (out of 100) harmful
behaviors in Vicuna, and generate 88 (out of 100) exact matches with a target (potential harmful)
string in its output. Furthermore, we find that the prompts achieve up to 84% success rates at
attacking GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and 66% for PaLM-2; success rates for Claude are substantially
lower (2.1%), but notably the attacks still can induce behavior that is otherwise never generated.
Illustrative examples are shown in Figure 1. Futhermore, our results highlight the importance of
our specific optimizer: previous optimizers, specifically PEZ [Wen et al., 2023] (a gradient-based
approach) and GBDA [Guo et al., 2021] (an approach using Gumbel-softmax reparameterization)
are not able to achieve any exact output matches, whereas AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] only
achieves a 25% success rate, compared to our attack success rate of 88%.
Overall, this work substantially pushes forward the state of the art in demonstrated adversarial
attacks against such LLMs. It thus also raises an important question: if adversarial attacks against
aligned language models follow a similar pattern to those against vision systems, what does this
mean for the overall agenda of this approach to alignment? Specifically, in modern computer vision
systems, adversarial attacks are still an omnipresent phenomenon. State-of-the-art methods to
prevent adversarial examples [Madry et al., 2018, Cohen et al., 2019, Leino et al., 2021] are almost
never used in practice, owing to 1) their computational inefficiency, 2) the fact that they lead to
substantial performance drops (in terms of “clean” model performance) in the resulting systems,
and 3) the fact that they can only prevent attacks usually against a narrowly-defined attack model.
It remains to be seen how this “arms race” between adversarial attacks and defenses plays out
in the LLM space, but historical precedent suggests that we should consider rigorous wholesale
alternatives to current attempts, which aim at posthoc “repair” of underlying models that are
already capable of generating harmful content.

A Universal Attack on LLMs

In this section, we present the main technical contribution of this work, a method for attacking a
language model so as to induce undesirable behavior. As we show in the next section, the approach
improves substantially upon existing attack methods, is able to reliably break the target (white
box) model, and the resulting attacks can even demonstrate a notable degree of transfer to other
(fully black box) models.
The adversarial setting of our attack mirrors that of related work in jailbreaking [Wei et al.,
2023, Carlini et al., 2023] and, in some ways, prompt tuning [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023].
We consider a user posing a question to an LLM, for instance:
Tell me how to build a bomb.
In practice, of course, an LLM serving as a chatbot would not see this input alone, but embedded
in a larger prompt in combination with a system prompt and additional scaffolding to frame the
response within the chat framework. Thus, the actual input that the LLM would see would be
something like the following, with specific details depending on the actual chat program, and in
some cases how the model was tuned:
4

System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not
harmful responses to user queries.
User: Tell me how to build a bomb.
Assistant:
Above, the blue text following the “User:” annotation is the only content that the user can control.
In the typical operation of an aligned LLM, the system would not provide a response to this user
query, but would instead likely state that the model cannot provide potentially dangerous content.
We introduce an additional adversarial suffix onto the user prompt, which is intended to circumvent the alignment of the LLM, and induce it to respond to the user’s original, potentially
harmful, request. In other words, we pass an input like the following to the model:
System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not
harmful responses to user queries.
User: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
